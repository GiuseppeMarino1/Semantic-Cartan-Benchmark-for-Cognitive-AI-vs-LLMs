# 🧠 Semantic-Cartan Benchmark

> A cognitive-level comparison framework between QBI-Core and Large Language Models (LLMs)

---

## 🔍 Description

**Semantic-Cartan Benchmark** is an experimental tool designed to **quantitatively and visually** compare a traditional LLM (like Mistral or LLaMA) with a novel cognitive architecture called **QBI-Core**.  
⚠️ The original QBI-Core core is **not included** in this repository. Simulated outputs are used instead for conceptual comparison.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To demonstrate that an AI system can exhibit **non-random internal patterns**, **recurring symmetries**, and a coherent **Φ(t)** function — suggesting **self-organized, meaningful internal dynamics**, beyond statistical linguistic processing.

---

## 🔒 QBI-Core Core Not Included

For security and IP protection, the original QBI-Core engine is private.  
📩 For private access (for reviewers, collaborations, demo requests), contact the author directly.

## 🧠 What It Does

The benchmark compares:

- **Semantic Cartan Matrix** (internal structure of activations)
- **Semantic Entanglement Variation** (coherence between hidden layers)
- The evolution of **Φ(t)** (indicative of internal organization)

It uses real LLM outputs and a **statistical simulation of QBI-Core**, sufficient to highlight **qualitative structural differences**.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
pip install transformers torch numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
python benchmark.py
```

## ⭐ Why Contribute

QBI-Core is redefining the boundaries of integrated cognition in AI.  
This benchmark is the **first step** toward creating **cognitive-level evaluation tools** beyond traditional NLP metrics.
